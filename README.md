# Cheatsheets

This repository is my second brain where I store useful configurations, scripts, and notes that I find helpful in my daily work.

If you find any of these configurations useful, feel free to use them as a reference or adapt them for your own setup. And if you're searching for detailed explanations of each configuration, you're in the right place but checkout my [site](https://mlorente.dev).
